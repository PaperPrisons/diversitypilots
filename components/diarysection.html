                    As an engineer you are usually stuck in an endless cycle of building the next billion-dollar product and in the world of every evolving and every updating software, most of our work is never permanent. But when you become an inventor and build something which no one ever thought of, you make a permanent mark of your existence in the tech industry. I still remember how happy I was when I filed my first patent back which was a moment of great joy and pride. And as time went by, I filed multiple patents and I felt more confident and more accomplished.

                    I would say that becoming a recognized innovator meant creativity for me. Often legal isn't seen as a creative department but Pure Inclusive Innovation program that the IP Team at Pure has built proves that wrong. After my experience, I am more confident in my ideas and sharing them. Becoming a recognized innovator taught me that you don't have to hold a specific title or have a certain tenure to make a difference. Everyone has something to offer, and change can come from the most unexpected places.

                    Previous to our first invention being approved, my team had never really wanted to submit anything, due to concerns about the possible negative impact that may result if it was not a success. With this first patent, we have put this concern behind us and are driving forward. The help and advice of the patent team has massively helped give us confidence in our abilities, as has as the slick process they have developed. The team and myself believe we are seen and perceived as the go-to experts in many areas of technology and much of this could be attributed or linked to this first patent.

                    The IP team came to the office to do a presentation on the Innovator program. A couple weeks later, I was in a situation where I heard a customer's struggle with the upgrade process due to his colorblindness. It seemed like there would be a simple fix for this accessibility issue and, while I thought it over, I thought I didn't know where to go with it. And then when I came to the office, I remembered the team's presentation and immediately reached out. The rest is history!

                    My family directly benefited from the patent awards I received … they helped increase the down payment on my home. This helped me put down more permanent roots in my community. We needed increased space at the time due to my third child on her way. My family know that I have received patents, and they know that my employer is happy with me. I have applied my engineering mind to help solve problems in my condo community and church, and have seen some benefit there.

                    My kids have bragged to their friends at school that I have a patent. My mom knows and I think I'm the first in my family to get one. So that's pretty cool for her when she talks to her friends about her son. I sent her a copy so she knows it is real. It's probably up on her wall next to the rabbit I finger-painted in school.
